test-task
In the text, find all duplicated words starting from the second sentence. In output should be printed the word and number of repeats. (ex. John: 3) Be aware that '.' is used to separate the sentences. Keep in mind that special chars (ex ';',','-') can't be counted as a word. If the text doesn't include repeated words, please throw the Exception with description "No repeated words"
